Missoula Ultimate Normalization

To normalize my database, I took steps to separate entities thoughtfully.
There are tables for person (supertype), then separate tables for board members and external members.
I created a new table for the plural attribute, contact info.
I used a bridge table to connect entities with a many to many relationship.

I ensured that all requirements were met for 3NF.
